## Kagi

`kagi` (insert unicode)  - Japanese for key - is a small mini-project I did for fun on categorizing the keys of a 61-key computer keyboard.

The meaning of a key derives not from its character mapping on our default keyboard of use, but by its spatial orientation.

For example, the QWERTY `r` key is *Upper West Two*.

Thus, Braille is used for the symbolic representations. Here is R, and W, and Spongebob Squarepants.

The name representations of are then Japanese.
